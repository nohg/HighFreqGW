  abstract = {Spherical gravitational wave detectors allow the analysis of multiple independent channels and, therefore, are able to determine gravitational wave directions and polarizations. There are two spherical detectors being developed now: MiniGRAIL (Netherlands) and Mario Schenberg (Brazil). Both share the same principle of detection and main features. They have done commissioning runs and shown progress in their development. We have presented here the status of Mario Schenberg. Its transducers have been redesigned for sensitivity improvements. While an offline analysis was already developed for MiniGRAIL, we have investigated a low latency data analysis technique for Mario Schenberg. Both analysis are based on directional detection.},
